# Cats vs. Dogs Predictor

This repository contains a Python program that uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to predict whether an image contains a cat or a dog. The model was built using Keras and TensorFlow, and it has been trained on a dataset of 8000 cat and dog images.

## Introduction

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a type of deep learning model that are particularly well-suited for image classification tasks. In this project, we have used CNNs to build a model that can classify images as either a cat or a dog.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and testing the model consists of a large collection of cat and dog images. Total of 10000 images were used, 2000 for testing and 8000 for training. The dataset is not included in this repository due to its size.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/BhavishyaPattanayak/CatsVsDogs_Prediction.git
## Results
The model was trained for 25 epochs and achieved an accuracy of around 80% on the test dataset. While this is a decent performance, further improvements can be made by fine-tuning the model architecture, increasing the dataset size, or adjusting hyperparameters.

## Requirements
1. Python 3.8
2. TensorFlow
3. Keras
